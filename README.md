Predictive analysis of unstructured data using artificial intelligence

Block 4 - Predictive analysis of unstructured data using artificial intelligence

C4.1 - Process unstructured data (image, text, audio) by creating processing functions using programming libraries such as TensorFlow or Numpy to transform them into matrices in order to make them interpretable by a deep learning algorithm

C4.2 - Develop adapted neural networks (classical, convolutional or recursive) by superimposing neural layers via programming libraries such as TensorFlow to analyse unstructured data in order to detect signals on the latter

C4.3 - Create a robust and accurate algorithm by configuring a deep pre-trained neural network to address prediction problems on massive volumes of data

C4.4 - Create unstructured data by building adversarial neural networks to construct new training bases for artificial intelligence applications 

C4.5 - Evaluate the performance of a deep machine learning algorithm by evaluating indicators on training and validation data in order to industrialise its use
